"Probability is one of the misunderstood subject on earth" - I heard it from someone's lecture. Since it is comparatively tough to understand so being author of this article even I can't I am proficient to calculate probability in any situation. My strategy is to learn basics of it and apply those basics on various problems until I get enough skills to move forward on complex stuffs like statistics, better part of which is probability. Anyway as this article based on basic probability I can't deny to write down definition of probability by no means but I want to ignore any formal definition of it rather here is few informal definition(s):

> Probability is the chance that something will happen - how likely it is that some event will occur. - From [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/probability.html)
> 
> Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. - From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)
> 
> According to me, probability gives us a limit of certainty along with a limit of un-certainty though. As people like to find certainty in real life, probability becomes popular topic to study to increase certainty in special situations where prediction or emotion don't work well

One more important information which is missed in definition is - probability is measured from 0 to 1 or you could say by percentage. Anyway I guess to study probability it's important to collect examples and make sense from those examples. So lets go through examples one by one.

###### Example 1 (An unbaised coin):
This is the simplest example of probability. Suppose you have a coin (unbaised) with 2 faces head and tail. If you toss the coin what is the chances of getting head ? It's 50-50. So answer is : 0.5. See solution section for more explanation.

###### Example 2 (Single dice):
Suppose you have a dice (unbaised) with 6 faces and faces are numbered from 1 to 6. If you roll the dice what are chances you get a face written 5 on it ? 

###### Example 3 (Two dices):
Let's make another example by extending previous example. Suppose you are a gambler and you have basic knowledge of probability. Your friend is nearby to you and you want to make some money by a simple gamble game. Game rule is, there are 2 dices (unbaised) and both of you have to pick a number between 1 and 12. After picking a number each one have to roll 2 dices one after one. In this game you picked the number 7 based on probability. Question is how did you calculate probability in this game to pick 7.

###### Example 4 (Birthday problem):
Its well-known and famous [Birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). Suppose 1 year has 365 days. You invited friends into your birthday party and there are total 23 people including you in the party. What are chances any two of these people have same birthday ?

###### Example 5 (Monty Hall problem):
Its more famous than the previous one. In fact it's brain teaser because more than thousand
